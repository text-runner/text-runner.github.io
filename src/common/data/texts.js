    "I also use both cocoa and chocolate for a richer flavor. This isn't a super-rich chocolate mousse, eaten by the thimbleful, but it's still rich enough for grown-ups, and not too sweet. You can mellow it out by omitting the cocoa, if you like, or by using semisweet chocolate instead of bittersweet. You can stir in instant espresso powder to go mocha, or dash in a slug of bourbon. As I said - infinitely adaptable.",
    "Want more puddings like this one? I'd love to share my book Bakeless Sweets with you. It's chock-full of homemade puddings, panna cotta, grain puddings, fruit jellies, trifles, and no-bake cookies and icebox cakes. Beyond chocolate and vanilla there's butterscotch pudding, Nutella pudding, even maple bourbon pudding!",
    "There is a function to the order in which ingredients are added to create the right texture. As soon as you begin mixing flour with a liquid and a fat, gluten is developed. Gluten is not desirable in cakes, so mix thoroughly, but as little as possible. Make sure you're using the correct flour. If your recipe calls for a cake or pastry flour then an all-purpose flour or bread flour will be too hard, creating a tough crumb.",
    "The best part about pizza is that it is actually pretty quick if you have everything ready to go. I'm going to share my exact method for baking pizza that I have been using for about 10 years now. It's tried and tested, and results in delicious, crispy-edged, perfectly cheesy pizza every time.",
    "During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.",
    "Both Put and Patch are used for updating a specific document, but the difference is the put method uses a whole updated entry to replace the entry in the database whereas the patch method takes only the properties to be updated and modifies only those properties and not the whole document.",
    "Now is the perfect time to talk about the most useful and important feature of FastAPI. If we are using other frameworks, we would need to depend on a third-party application like Postman to check if our post method is working correctly. Whereas in FastAPI, they have provided us with not one but two pieces of ddocumentation to test our API calls.",
    "My husband and I first made it several years ago for Valentine's Day as a way to avoid the restaurant craze and spend time together making a special meal, and now it has become a tradition for us every year. And we love it so much we can't limit it to one day a year anymore, and make it on occasion for dinner.",
    "We are fortunate to have access to sushi grade raw fish, but you can still make sushi at home if you can't find some. Shrimp tempura rolls are one of my favorites, or you could do a California roll or a veggie roll. One of our favorites is a Philly roll, with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and cucumber.",
    "Bake, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom midway through, until the meat is dried out, 3 to 4 hours. To determine if the jerky is thoroughly dried out, take a piece out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature. It should be dry to the touch, leather-like in appearance, and chewy but still somewhat tender.",
    "The trick to a good classic stuffing from scratch is making sure your bread is really dry before you add broth. If you buy your bread a few days early, tear it or cut it into cubes and dry them in a bowl for a few days on your counter. Any kind of bread will do, I most often use a combo of brown and white.",

    "Random Text Generator is a web application which provides true random text which you can use in your documents or web designs. How does it work? First we took many books available on project Gutenberg and stored their contents in a database. Then a computer algorithm takes the words we stored earlier and shuffles them into sentences and paragraphs.",
    "As you can easily notice the second block of text looks more realistic. This way when you show a design to a client you can have a result that resembles the final product. However you can also use this text when you need meaningless text in the background of a design for a poster, t-shirt or whatever else you please.",

    "The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the weather north of the canyon. Huge thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no idea what was coming.",
    "It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.",
    "There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land.",
    "There were two things that were important to Tracey. The first was her dog. Anyone that had ever met Tracey knew how much she loved her dog. Most would say that she treated it as her child. The dog went everywhere with her and it had been her best friend for the past five years. The second thing that was important to Tracey, however, would be a lot more surprising to most people.",
    "The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. Dave knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness. Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't.",
    "The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun. He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that's exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it.",
    "This is important to remember. Love isn't like pie. You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more.

    "A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.",
    "Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.",
    "It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.",
    "Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project.",
    "No! All of the paragraphs in the generator are written by humans, not computers. When first building this generator we thought about using computers to generate the paragraphs, but they weren't very good and many times didn't make any sense at all. We therefore took the time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.",
    "There are usually about 200 words in a paragraph, but this can vary widely. Most paragraphs focus on a single idea that's expressed with an introductory sentence, then followed by two or more supporting sentences about the idea. A short paragraph may not reach even 50 words while long paragraphs can be over 400 words long, but generally speaking they tend to be approximately 200 words in length.",
    "My first memorable encounter with borscht was at a pot-luck party I had in San Francisco, in which my friend Elisabeth brought a huge, must have been 12 or 16-quart, pot of drop-dead delicious, deep purply red soup filled with beets.",

    "Mayonnaise is a flavorful emulsion of eggs, oil, vinegar, and seasonings. We already add it to so many dishes, like hamburgers, potato salads, and dressings, to keep things moist. So it makes sense that coating chicken with mayo would result in a tender and juicy meal.",
    "Baking and grilling chicken can dry out the meat - especially lean chicken breast - and there's seriously nothing worse than dry chicken. Because chicken isn't a very fatty cut of meat, you'll want to add some fat to keep the meat hydrated. Most recipes use butter or oil for cooking chicken, but mayo is the better fat option when it comes to producing juicy chicken."
